## Development

Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), and install the dependencies - `yarn install`.

Run the [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) test suite with `yarn test`.

This project uses [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) for automated NPM package publishing.

The main caveat: instead of running `git commit`, run `yarn commit` and follow the prompts to input a conventional changelog message via [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli).
